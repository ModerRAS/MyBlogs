# Writing At First
Coffee's class I think is familiar with Python's. Because of the grammar.
# About Class
## Writing An Example
```
class MyClass

    constructor: (name) ->
        @name = name

    getName: () ->
        @name
    setName: (name) ->
        @name = name
```
`constructor` is likes its name, it's a construct function.
